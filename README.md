SublimeStringGoTo
=================

If you click `ctrl + shift + o` SublimeStringGoTo will attempt to use that string as a filename, and open the file for you if it exists.

Currently, for python files, if you have a string, say, `"folder.filename.function"`, SublimeStringGoTo will attempt to open up that file and take you to where that `function` is declared in the file. This also works for classes and variables.
